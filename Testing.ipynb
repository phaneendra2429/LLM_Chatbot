The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery.\\nIf you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help.\", metadata={'row': 5, 'source': 'Data\\\\csv\\\\faq.csv'})]\n",
