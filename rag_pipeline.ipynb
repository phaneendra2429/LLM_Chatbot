There is no single cause. \\nStressors or events that cause a stressful \\nresponse and genetic factors can cause \\ndepression. Stressors can be triggers \\nthat result from pediatric illnesses and \\ndiseases, such as viral infections; diseases \\nof the thyroid and endocrine system; head \\ninjury; epilepsy; and heart, kidney, and lung \\ndiseases. A family history of depression \\nis a major genetic factor; a child can be \\nmore prone to becoming depressed if \\na parent or sibling has been diagnosed \\nwith depression. Stressors in everyday \\nlife also contribute to the development \\nof depression, for example, the loss of a \\nclose loved one; parents frequently arguing, \\nseparating, or divorcing; school changes; \\nand family financial problems. Finally, \\ndevelopmental factors, such as learning \\nand language disabilities, are sometimes \\noverlooked. Other mental illnesses and \\nsymptoms, such as attention-deficit/\\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, \\nfears, and excessive shyness, in addition \\nto not having opportunities to develop \\ninterests and show strengths and talents, \\ncan add to depression.\\nWhat are the symptoms \\nof depression?\\n• Depressed, sad, or irritable mood\\n• Significant loss of interest or pleasure \\nin activities\\n• Significant weight loss, weight gain, or \\nappetite changes\\n• Difficulty falling asleep and/or staying \\nasleep or sleeping too much\\n• Restlessness, unable to sit still (referred \\nto as psychomotor agitation), or \\nbeing slowed down (referred to as \\npsychomotor slowing)\\n• Fatigue or loss of energy\\n• Feelings of worthlessness or excessive \\nor inappropriate feelings of guilt\\n• Difficulties in concentrating or \\nmaking decisions\\n• Constant thoughts of death, suicidal \\nthinking, or a suicide attempt', metadata={'source': 'DepressionGuide-web.pdf', 'file_path': 'DepressionGuide-web.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20190521112126-04'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20190620101312-04'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",
