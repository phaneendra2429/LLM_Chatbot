And Hollywood culture hasn't helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive, there's something to worry about.\\u00c2\\u00a0It's been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships. So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman. For example:Where did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?\\u00c2\\u00a0Why don't you want to be friends with her (i.e., what do you mean by \\\"kind of crazy\\\")? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman's hamburger, and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about, she may start to come around.Now, IF she's more concerned that you might be taking this woman's calls behind your back, while I'm not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records, you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up, I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g., little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages, buy a rose or her favorite flower, have her car detailed, do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea). \\u00c2\\u00a0Bottom line - show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with, you CHOSE HER. \\u00c2\\u00a0And would continue to do so all over again. \\u00c2\\u00a0AND why you love HER as a person. \\u00c2\\u00a0This will help her trust what you're saying.\\u00c2\\u00a0Best of luck to you! \\u00c2\\u00a0Tamara Powell, LMHC\",\n          \"Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things\\nthat people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel\\nconnected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if\\nwe feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. \\nI don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t know the specifics about your relationship or how\\ncomfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those\\nsituations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to\\nthat would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you\\nbelieve that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like\\nthere is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case\\nthen remaining safe is your top priority. \\nAssuming you are able to share with him your feelings,\\ntelling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate\\nand sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for\\nall parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153no\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d to\\nabsolutely anything they are not comfortable with. \\nI call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153sex\\ntrust.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they\\nwon\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or\\ncoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. \\u00c2\\u00a0Your personal safety and mental well-being is\\nwhat is most important. \\nNow, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM\\nand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you\\ncan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles\\nare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. \\nMany people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but\\nagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is\\nalso important to know that BDSM is not\\u00c2\\u00a0just one thing and people practice it\\ndifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,\\nthen you shouldn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t feel obligated to do it.\\n\\u00c2\\u00a0\\nI hope this was helpful. Be well.\\n\\u00c2\\u00a0\\nRobin J.
